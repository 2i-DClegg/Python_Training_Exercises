# Challenge Title: 🪵 Log Detective – The Case of the Vanishing Server 
(Estimated time 2+ hours)

## Scenario: 
You’ve just landed your first job as a Junior DevOps Assistant at a company that loves logs almost as much as they love blaming interns. Just as you’re settling in with your first coffee of the day, your manager storms over:  

“The system had a wobble overnight, and we need a report ASAP. Think you can scan the logs for anything critical?”  

## Your mission:
No pressure. Your mission is to build a Python script that combs through messy log files looking for important keywords like "ERROR" and "CRITICAL", then produces a clean, human-friendly summary. If you nail it, you might just earn “trusted script writer” status on the QE Helpdesk channel.

## Key learning outcomes:
This challenge reinforces the following fundamentals:  

- File handling: Read and process log files line by line.  
- Strings & operators: Use string methods and logical checks to find keywords.  
- Loops: Iterate through lines in the file efficiently.  
- Functions: Separate concerns (e.g., read_logs(), generate_report() functions).  
- Git/GitHub: Practice uploading and sharing code in a professional format.
